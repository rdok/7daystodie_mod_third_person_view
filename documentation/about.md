[![Third Person View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdok/7daystodie_mod_third_person_view/main/documentation/showcase.gif)](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5903)

## Features
- Activates third-person view mode with the Alt key.
- It's highly recommended to enable [Dot Crosshair](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5640) and [Immersive Crosshair](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5601) for a better experience while in third-person mode. 
  - These mods will properly hide the crosshair when in first person view, while enabling when in third person view, giving you the best of both worlds. 
  - Refer to the [screenshots tab](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1059/images/5903/5903-1724496760-686489418.jpeg) for examples.
- To remap the Alt key: go to Options -> Keyboard/Mouse -> Edit Mode -> Change Camera.
  - This is especially recommended if you use Alt+Tab to switch between windows.
  - If you would like controller support, please post a request, specifying which button you'd prefer for mapping.
- Enables the step sounds, which have been disabled by the game developers when not in first person view.  
- **Note that the third-person view is incomplete, as the game developers have not fully implemented it:**  
  - Bow animations, are unfinished (static). 
  - Although knife animations are working, they are not hitting anything. Thanks to [lM3Rl](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5903?tab=posts&jump_to_comment=143233440) for reporting this issue.
  - I'll update this as we find more issues; once we have confirmed all the issues, I'll further patch this mod to fix everything code related; for the missing animations someone else with animation expertise can create a mod for that.
- Game Version: 1.0. Install with [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).

## Backlog
> Ordered by priority  
- Support controllers: Use [right on the d-pad](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5903?tab=posts&jump_to_comment=143236233) to toggle the view.
- Knife attacks are not interacting/hitting.
- After releasing the zoom in button holding a weapon, the game snaps the camera too fast. Smoothen this out to improve the UX.
- Provide the options to zoom in or out.
- Missing animations for bows; help needed, or some other developer create this mod separately.
