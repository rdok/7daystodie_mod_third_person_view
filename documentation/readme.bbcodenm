[size=5]Features[/size]
[list]
[*] Activates third-person view mode with the Alt key.
[*] It's highly recommended to enable [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5640]Dot Crosshair[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5601]Immersive Crosshair[/url] for better experience while in third-person mode, regardless of the weapon equipped. Refer to the [url=https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1059/images/5903/5903-1724496760-686489418.jpeg]screenshots tab[/url] for examples.
[*] Note that the third-person view mod is incomplete, as the game developers have not fully implemented it. Some features, like animations (e.g., bow attacks), are unfinished.
[*] To remap the Alt key: go to Options -> Keyboard/Mouse -> Edit Mode -> Change Camera.
[list]
[*] This is especially recommended if you use Alt+Tab to switch between windows.
[*] If you would like controller support, please post a request, specifying which button you'd prefer for mapping.[/list]
[*] Game Version: 1.0. Install with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/]Vortex[/url].

[size=5]Backlog[/size]
[list]
[*] After releasing the zoom in button holding a weapon, the game snaps the camera too fast. Smoothen this out to improve the UX.
