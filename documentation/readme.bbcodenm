[list]
[*] Activates third-person view mode with the Alt key.
[*] Patches
[list]
[*] Enables the step sounds, which have been disabled by the game developers when not in first person view.
[*] Support for controllers.[/list]
[*] To remap the Alt key: go to Options -> Keyboard/Mouse -> Edit Mode -> Change Camera.
[list]
[*] This is especially recommended if you use Alt+Tab to switch between windows.
[*] If you are interested to remap this for the controller as well, please leave a comment with your use case.
[*] Controllers: double tap whatever you sneak toggle is mapped to. By default, is the right analog stick.[/list]
[*] It's recommended to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5640]Dot Crosshair[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5601]Immersive Crosshair[/url] for a better experience while in third-person mode.
[list]
[*] These mods will properly hide the crosshair when in first person view, while enabling when in third person view, giving you the best of both worlds.

[*] Power attacks are not hitting enemies.[/list]
[*] When I spam power attack with club, animation stops. Thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5903?tab=posts&jump_to_comment=143252268]MrSamuelAdams1992[/url] fore reporting this issue.
[*] Impact drive not disassembling. Thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5903?tab=posts&jump_to_comment=143263098]kiosuku1943[/url] for reporting this issue.
[*] Missing sound when using wrench on cars. Thanks to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5903?tab=posts&jump_to_comment=143244357]Splico[/url] for reporting this issue.
[*] Missing animations for bows; help needed, or some other developer to create this mod separately.
[*] Hack to go around the issue with equipment not working, or having no animations:
[list]
[*] Whenever the player uses a such equipment, force the camera back to first person. 
[*] On next iteration, integrate Gears, to allow the players to disable this feature if they don't want to use it.

[*] After releasing the zoom in button holding a weapon, the game snaps the camera too fast. Smoothen this out to improve the UX.
[*] Provide the options to zoom in or out.
