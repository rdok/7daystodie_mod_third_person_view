[![Third Person View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdok/7daystodie_mod_third_person_view/main/documentation/showcase.gif)](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5716)

## Features
- Enables the third person view mode, using Alt keyboard button.
- Note that the game developers have not added all animations. E.g. bow animations attacks are static.
- To remap the Alt button: Options -> Keyboard/Mouse -> Edit Mode -> Change Camera
  - This is highly recommended if you use alt+tab to switch windows. 
  - If you'd like controller support please make a post including which button should that be mapped to.
- Game Version: 1.0. Install with [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).

## Changelog
#### v1.0.0 24-Aug-24
- feat: Enable the change camera used in edit mode without requiring the debug mode on.

## Backlog
- After releasing the zoom in button holding a weapon, the game snaps the camera too fast. Smoothen this out to improve the UX.
