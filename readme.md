[![Third Person View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdok/7daystodie_mod_third_person_view/main/documentation/showcase.gif)](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5903)

## Features
- Activates third-person view mode with the Alt key.
- It's highly recommended to enable [Dot Crosshair](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5640) and [Immersive Crosshair](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5601) for a better experience while in third-person mode. 
  - These mods will properly hide the crosshair when in first person view, while enabling when in third person view, giving you the best of both worlds. 
  - Refer to the [screenshots tab](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1059/images/5903/5903-1724496760-686489418.jpeg) for examples.
- Note that the third-person view is incomplete, as the game developers have not fully implemented it. Some features, like bow animations, are unfinished (static). Firearms and melee look good enough.
- To remap the Alt key: go to Options -> Keyboard/Mouse -> Edit Mode -> Change Camera.
  - This is especially recommended if you use Alt+Tab to switch between windows.
  - If you would like controller support, please post a request, specifying which button you'd prefer for mapping.
- Game Version: 1.0. Install with [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).

## Changelog
#### v1.0.0 24-Aug-24
- feat: Enable the change camera used in edit mode without requiring the debug mode on.

## Backlog
- After releasing the zoom in button holding a weapon, the game snaps the camera too fast. Smoothen this out to improve the UX.
